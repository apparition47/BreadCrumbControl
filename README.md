BreadCrumb Control for iOS written in Swift.

![animatedsample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298414/29718787-d5afe59c-89ee-11e7-8a03-88c92656265e.gif)

The properties of "BreadCrumb" are fully accessible for the developer: color, animation, etc.
This control is provided with a sample application that lets you change the properties of the control in real-time.


# Compatibility

This control is compatible with iOS 8. Swift 3.0 compatible.


# Installation in Xcode project

It is a very easy control to include in your project.

## Manually

Add to your iOS project: `BreadCrumb.swift`, `CustomButton.swift`, `BreadCrumbs.xcassets`.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate this into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'BreadCrumbControl'
end
```

## Carthage

BreadCrumbControl is [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/) compatible.
Add the following into your `Cartfile`, then run `carthage update`.

```
github "apparition47/BreadCrumbControl"
```

# Usage

In order to use BreadCrumb control, you can instantiate it programmatically, or create a custom view in Interface Builder and assign it to an ivar of your app. Once you have an instance, you can use the control properties to configure it.
See `ViewController.swift` for detail code.

```swift
import BreadCrumbControl // if using CocoaPods or Carthage 

class ViewController: UIViewController {
	@IBOutlet weak var breadcrumbControl: CBreadcrumbControl!
	override func viewDidLoad() {
        self.breadcrumbView.delegate = self

        self.breadcrumbView.buttonFont = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 16)
        self.breadcrumbView.style = .gradientFlatStyle
		self.breadcrumbView.itemsBreadCrumb = ["Config", "Alarm"]
	}
}

extension ViewController: BreadCrumbControlDelegate {
    func didTouchItem(index: Int, item: String) {
        let alertView = UIAlertView();
        alertView.addButton(withTitle: "OK")
        alertView.title = "Item touched"
        alertView.message = "\(item) (index= \(index))"
        alertView.show()
    }

    func didTouchRootButton() {
        let alertView = UIAlertView();
        alertView.addButton(withTitle: "OK")
        alertView.title = "Root button touched"
        alertView.show()
    }
}
```

# Credits

For the sample application I use the control "ColorPickerView", created by Ethan Strider on 11/28/14. This control allowed me to easily change the colors in the sample application.

The BreadCrumb and the sample application have been created by Philippe Kersal√©.
